<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Mayank Kushwaha. I am from Kanpur, India. I have lived in the States for 9+ years.
  I did my bachelors of science in Industrial Engineering from State University of New York at Buffalo.
  Then i worked as a Business analyst in San Antonio, Texas for 2+ years for a company called USAA. 
  I saved some money during my work in USA therefore i decided to either go on a world tour or 
  invest my money in education. I ended up obtaining another masters from US at the time 
  when data replaced the world's most valuable resource ("Oil!"), with a masters in Database technologies.

<p>I went back to India in 2017 to work for an agricultural firm.
  Meanwhile  I did part of my masters online and obtained my degree in August 2017.</p>

<p>From 2017 until 2022, I invested my whole time in agriculture firm in India as a lead financial officer.

  With my skills not up to the standards, I again decided 
  to come to Canada to upskill myself in computer programming. 
  So i obtained a diploma in computer programming from Algonquin College.
  Now that I have gained enough confidence in developing software products, I am available to work 
  online, onsite as well hybrid and I am actively looking for work.
  I can also provide my services online and work part time or on hourly basis depending on
  the project demand and milestones.</p>

<p>
  I am also a person who is into meditation and yoga and fitness. 
  I like to eat vegetarian and healthy meals.
  I believe in knowing oneself before we venture out in this world. 
  "Know thyself" is the beginning of all wisdom.
